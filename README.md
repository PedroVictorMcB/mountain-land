# Dummy Project

This project aims to show my skill and techs as software developer.  
Here I used react, typescript, css, hooks, router dom, firebase, and consumed a dummy api to create a login and register system.

## Testing the Project

### Login

-   username: emmaj
-   password: emmajpass

### Register

-   You just have to fill the fields and you should receive a confirmation via toast.
    NOTE: SINCE IS A DUMMYAPI THE USER ISN'T BEING REGISTERED.

### Recover Password

-   Use the following e-mail to simulate a recover process: emily.johnson@x.dummyjson.com
    NOTE: For testing an error just insert any e-mail that isn't of the dummyjson.

#### `DUMMYJSON`
